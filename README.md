# MATLAB m-files

These files will calculate and plot the scattered wave field for spherical cavities and elastic spheres within an elastic medium. 

# spherewf.m - calculates and plots scattered wavefield of sphereical cavity.
# spherewf_elastic.m - calculates and plots scattered wavefield of spherical elastic inclusion in elastic medium. 

Both files are capable of 3D spherical plots using the sphere3d.m function written by J De Freitas that can be obtained 
from the mathworks website here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8585-3d-plot-on-a-spherical-surface
